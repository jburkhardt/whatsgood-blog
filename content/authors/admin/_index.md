I am Matthias. I am a software developer with an economics / statistics background.
LinkedIn aficionados would probably say I am a *data scientist*. After completing my doctorate, I moved to the [ETH Zurich'](https://www.ethz.ch) IT department, more precisely the [KOF Swiss Economic Institute's](https://kof.ethz.ch) IT. I help to make establishment statistics' data pipelines more convenient, but also help empirical researchers of different fields to adopt software development habits. I enjoy contributing to open source software, most notably the RAdwords interface, timeseriesdb, tstools and kofdata.
