<p>I cannot run a blog. I’ve failed several times at blogging which is why
I decided to fail better this time.</p>
<p>I happily suffer from multi-interest desease
and have a hard time streamlining my posts or sharpen the profile of my personal
weblog. But still, I enjoy having a personal log. But still, I receive feedback, my
talks, workshops, advice, hacking and thoughts are actually interesting to others.</p>
<p>So I decided to let it (the strive for streamlining and profile tuning) go.
I will just run this as a site to say hi to the stats community + collect my slides,
my code and my notes on devOpping in data science / academia.
Also expect a little sports blended in.</p>
<p>Basically I’ve been here all the time hacking at rstats, gut-checking new stack,
analyzing visualizing, architecting, teaching and discussing. I’ve been around all
of these things for 10+ years. Also in the nearby future, there should plenty
to write about from useR to my endeavors in official statistics to my R package
contributions and the NBA. Besides, I brought some of my old blog posts so the editorial won’t be
too lonely up here. I guess, I will continue to bring back some of my older posts by popular demand.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
<p>Matt</p>
