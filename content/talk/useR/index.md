abstract: The timeseriesdb framework maps R time series representations to PostgreSQL key-value pair storage and links data descriptions in a relational manner. Combining key-value pairs with relational database features results in a light-weight but powerful architecture that keeps maintenance at a minimum as it allows to store a large number of records without the need for multiple partitions. The timeseriesdb framework was tailored to the needs of official and economic statistics with long term data conservation in mind - It handles data revisions (vintages), release dates and elaborate, multi-lingual meta information.
