abstract: This talk shows how the KOF Swiss Economic Institute uses open source components to innovate in the field of economic statistics -- from the development and documentation of methods to the implementation of highly respected indicators and timely publication pipelines. Along the way, the CRAN extension packages 'tstools' and 'kofdata' for the R language for Statistical Computing will be presented. 'tstools' is a package to export time series data efficiently and make visualization of time series flexible, yet convenient. 'kofdata' is an API wrapper that allows R (and Python) users to easily consume time series data from the KOF Datenservice REST web application programming interface (API) and thus facilitates automation of publication and exchange of data.
