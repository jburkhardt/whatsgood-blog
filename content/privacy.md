Privacy Policy 

## General 

Yes, I do use cookies and standard, state-of-the-art web analytics.
I do so to improve my content based on what is read and what's not. 
I do not analyze user level data but rather look at aggregated user data 
over different time spans or regions. Also, this is simply my personal website.
I tell you a bit about myself and you need to agree to share the traces that your 
vistit leaves on my website including the involved third party products if you want to visit my 
website. 


## Who collects your data ?

Just like many others, I use Google Analytics. My blog uses the [Academic 
theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/) for the [Go](https://golang.org/)
driven [Hugo static website generator](https://gohugo.io/) and is hosted on 
[github.com])(https://github.com/mbannert) which belongs to Microsoft. 
Thus user data are transferred to third party servers, with Google servers among
them.
