If circumstances make you extend the\noriginal group, build trust and turn a group of local organizers into a\ntruly global team all while moving on with the organization, that\nexperience becomes even more unique.\nOut of the impact of an all virtual useR! 2021 which has undoubtedly\nbeen the most global useR! conference ever, the team of global\ncoordinators is looking to establish a permanent useR! working group.\nAfter reaching so many people that could not have attended an in person\nconference, it is safe to say that a strong online component is there to\nstay. To help develop this online component further a new useR! working\ngroup is in its seeding phase.\nTogether with @hturner,\nIâ€™ve administered a Google Season of Docs project to document the useR!\nconference. The project resulted in a knowledgebase and\nan information\ndashboardto help new organizers stop reinventing the wheel and off\nto a kickstart.\nWhat Workers\nWant: National Research Program 77\nTogether with the head KOFâ€™s labor market group, Michael\nSiegenthaler, I am a co-PI in an SNF funded National Research Program 77\nproject. The project makes use of novel data from a public employment\nplatform to investigate how unemployed job seekers search for work\nonline. The aim is to better understand trends on the Swiss labour\nmarket and the success factors of job searches, and to optimise work\nplacement.\nSNF Research database\n| Project\nPage SNF\nHacking for Social Sciences\nHacking for Social Sciences is a PhD level course, an online book and\na mission to teach young research the data automation tricks I wish I\nhad known when I started my PhD.\nproject postcard | online book\nuseR! 2021 global\nIn 2021, I was a global coordinator (co-chair) of useR!, the annual\nconference of the R Project for Statistical Computing.\nuseR! 2021 website | useR! 2021 blog\nSwissdata - Making Public\nData Public\nSwissdata is a joint effort with @christop_sax to make publicly\navailable data machine readable and therefore processible.

Essentially, {timeseriesdb} maps R language time series\nrepresentations to PostgreSQL relations. In addition to capabilities to\npersistently store time series themselves in a database, {timeseriesdb}\nallows for fine grained access rules, multi-lingual meta description as\nwell as vintages (versions) of time series which allows for realtime\nanalysis.\nThese features make {timeseriesdb} an ideal fit to manage and archive\ntime series in official statistics and other time series that are\npotentially revised. {timeseriesdb} is reliable, light weight option to\nstore and manage millions of time series â€“ even from individuals to\nenterprises, academic researchers and public administration. Its SQL\nbackend and architecture allows to easily add a REST interface to\n{timeseriesdb} and expose time series data through an REST API.\nDocumentation: mbannert.github.com/timeseriesdb\nGitHub Development Repository: github.com/mbannert/timeseriesdb\nComprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/timeseriesdb/index.html\n{r4googleads} R\nPackage - Read Google Ads Data into R\n{r4googleads} is the successor of my most successful open source\ncontribution in terms of popularity.
