If circumstances make you extend the original group, build trust and turn a group of local organizers into a truly global team all while moving on with the organization, that experience becomes even more unique.\nOut of the impact of an all virtual useR! 2021 which has undoubtedly been the most global useR! conference ever, the team of global coordinators is looking to establish a permanent useR! working group. After reaching so many people that could not have attended an in person conference, it is safe to say that a strong online component is there to stay. To help develop this online component further a new useR! working group is in its seeding phase.\nTogether with [@hturner](https://twitter.com/heathrturnr), Iâ€™ve administered a Google Season of Docs project to document the useR! conference. The project resulted in a knowledgebase and an information dashboardto help new organizers stop reinventing the wheel and off to a kickstart.\nWhat Workers Want: National Research Program 77\nTogether with the head KOFâ€™s labor market group, Michael Siegenthaler, I am a co-PI in an SNF funded National Research Program 77 project. The project makes use of novel data from a public employment platform to investigate how unemployed job seekers search for work online. The aim is to better understand trends on the Swiss labour market and the success factors of job searches, and to optimise work placement.\nSNF Research database | Project Page SNF\nHacking for Social Sciences\nHacking for Social Sciences is a PhD level course, an online book and a mission to teach young research the data automation tricks I wish I had known when I started my PhD.\nproject postcard | online book\nuseR! 2021 global\nIn 2021, I was a global coordinator (co-chair) of useR!, the annual conference of the R Project for Statistical Computing.\nuseR! 2021 website | useR! 2021 blog\nSwissdata - Making Public Data Public\nSwissdata is a joint effort with @christop_sax to make publicly available data machine readable and therefore processible. We read adverse spreadsheets and turn them into a smooth-sailing pair of long format .csv and .json (or .yaml) meta information. We cooperate with local and federal administration in Switzerland to re-publish information in machine readable fashion.\nswissdata demo\nDigital Lives (SNF)\nMigration of the KOF Time Series Database\n\n\n\n",

Currently, I do programming with data and therefore mostly SQL, R and Python these days. Expect some web development, data visualization and devOps routine blended in from time to time. ",

Interaction with learners adds an extra perspective for instructors and helps scholars to communicate better. I am thankful for the great output *and* input I've received through my courses and workshops and enjoy teaching a lot. Though not a fulltime lecturer, I try to teach workshop or course every semester (or at least every year). ",
