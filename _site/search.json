For all my other work that cannot be easily bundled into package and be deployed somewhere, I am happy to be able to summarize them as 'projects'.",

Currently, I do programming with data and therefore mostly SQL, R and Python these days. Expect some web development, data visualization and devOps routine blended in from time to time. ",

      "description": "I believe teaching is an essential part of research. To me, teaching is so much more than 'just' onboarding the next generation of researchers. Interaction with learners adds an extra perspective for instructors and helps scholars to communicate better. I am thankful for the great output *and* input I've received through my courses and workshops and enjoy teaching a lot. Though not a fulltime lecturer, I try to teach workshop or course every semester (or at least every year). ",
